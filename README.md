Reducks is a tool to create animated visualizations of work on either a single
repository, or a series of repositories that match a regular expression pattern,
to help give a different perspective of work done in git. Consider it like
rubber-ducking for your workflows and processes for your work.

## Installation

In order to use Reducks, you will need to install `gource` and `ffmpeg`. If
you're using macOS and Homebrew, you should be able to easily install them with
the following commands.

```shell
brew install gource
brew install ffmpeg
```

After those dependencies are met, you should be able to run the scripts in the
`source/` directories to create visualizations, animated gifs, or mpeg videos
for your repositories.
